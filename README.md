**Overview of the Analysis**

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. In order to accomplish this task, the following deliverables were achieved: 
*   Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
*   Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
*   Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

**Results**

After data analysis for the two months of June and December, the following was reviewed: 

*   For the month of June:

*   For the month of December:

_Differences_

Between the months of June and December there are clear differences: 
    *    The mean temp for June is higher at 74.94 where as the mean temp for December is 71.04
    *    The minimum temp for June is 64.0 and the minimum temp for December is 56.0  
    *    The maximum temp for June is 85.0 and the maximum temo for December is 83.0 
    
**Summary**

When reviewing the data at a high-level analysis, there are slight similarities in the data. For example the standard deviation for June is 3.25 and the standard deviation for December is 3.75 meaning the temp for June and December both vary at almost a 10 degree shift from the mean (+/- 3 in either direction) and there is only a .5 difference in standard deviation between the months. While the quartile values and miniumum and maximum values are fairly similar, it is apparent that the average (mean) for June is noticably higher at almost 5 degrees warmer. 

_Additional Queries_

Of course not just temperature is important to gather when opening a business desgined for beach amenitites. Other queries I would gather would be to analyze precipitation throughout the months. This would be important because as described in the prompt, the first year the business was opened it was rained out. Another query I would analyze is wind speed at different locations where the business may be built. Of course on the beach wind direction and speed can vary drastically depending on the flattness of the land or if there are other landmark barriers impeding wind speed. This may be important to also calculate the potential success of the business.
